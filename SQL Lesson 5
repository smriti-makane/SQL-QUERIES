SQL Lesson 5: Multi-table queries with JOINs

Syntax, 
Select query with INNER JOIN on multiple tables
SELECT column, another_table_column, …
FROM mytable
INNER JOIN another_table 
    ON mytable.id = another_table.id
WHERE condition(s)
ORDER BY column, … ASC/DESC
LIMIT num_limit OFFSET num_offset;

Examples, 
1.Find the domestic and international sales for each movie
SELECT title , domestic_sales, international_sales FROM movies
inner join boxoffice on id = movie_id;

2.Show the sales numbers for each movie that did better internationally rather than domestically
SELECT title , domestic_sales, international_sales FROM movies
inner join boxoffice on id= movie_id
where domestic_sales<international_sales; 

3.List all the movies by their ratings in descending order
SELECT title, rating FROM movies
inner join boxoffice on id=movie_id
Order by rating DESC;
