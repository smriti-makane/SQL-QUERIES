SQL Lesson 4: Filtering and sorting Query results

Syntax, 

Select query with ordered results
SELECT column, another_column, …
FROM mytable
WHERE condition(s)
ORDER BY column ASC/DESC;

Select query with limited rows

FROM mytable

1.List all directors of Pixar movies (alphabetically), without duplicates
SELECT DISTINCT director FROM movies
ORDER BY director ASC;

2.List the last four Pixar movies released (ordered from most recent to least)
SELECT TITLE, YEAR FROM movies
ORDER BY YEAR DESC
LIMIT 4;

3.List the first five Pixar movies sorted alphabetically
SELECT TITLE FROM movies
ORDER BY TITLE ASC

4.List the next five Pixar movies sorted alphabetically
SELECT TITLE FROM movies
ORDER BY TITLE ASC
LIMIT 5
OFFSET 5;
